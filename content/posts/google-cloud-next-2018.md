At [Google Cloud Next](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/sf/) this year, I presented two talks.

### Proactively Stocking Inventory using Machine Learning

The basic premise was somewhat simple: could standard in-store cameras be used to monitor inventory? The example I used was based on having to restock produce in a timely manner by notifying store associates that specific items were out of stock.

The talk was recorded and is available below. The code for my demos is at [crcsmnky/stocking-inventory](https://github.com/crcsmnky/stocking-inventory) on Github.

### End to End Collaborative Data Workflows

My goal for this talk was to walk through the order of operations and tools needed to accomplish a standard data workflow. Specifically, I go through the steps, tools, and processes for the following:

- Cleansing and preparing data
- Storing data in warehouse
- Analyzing using SQL and basic reporting
- Analyzing using Jupyter notebooks
- Building and deploying Tensorflow models to make recommendations

The talk was recorded and is available below. I'm still working on making some of the demo code available.

I work on Production Engineering at [Verily](https://verily.com) as an SRE, helping make prod more secure, reliable, and observable for Verily engineering teams. I help teams architect and implement their solutions using [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) and tools like [Cloud Run](https://cloud.run), [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Istio](https://istio.io), and many others.

My background is in software engineering and Iâ€™ve worked for [Google](https://cloud.google.com), [VMware](https://vmware.com), [Apple](http://apple.com), [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com), and many others. I have managed and grown technical teams of DevRel Engineers and Solutions Architects. I have designed and delivered reference architectures and best practices for cloud native deployments, hybrid infrastructure, and large scale data processing pipelines, and developed software systems to analyze social networks, document similarity, and text sentiment.

I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu) and a Masters in Computer Engineering from the [University of Texas](http://utexas.edu).

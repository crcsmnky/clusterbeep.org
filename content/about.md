I am a Developer Advocate for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), where I focus on helping teams adopt [DevOps tools and practices](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/capabilities), using cloud native technologies like [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io), [Istio](http://istio.io), and [Knative](https://knative.dev). 

My background is in software engineering and I've worked for [VMware](https://vmware.com), [Apple](http://apple.com), [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com), Ravel, [21CT](http://21ct.com), and [Affinegy](http://affinegy.com). I've developed reference architectures and best practices for running hybrid infrastructure deployments and large-scale data processing pipelines, as well as software systems to analyze social networks, document similarity, and text sentiment. 

I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu) and a Masters in Computer Engineering from the [University of Texas](http://utexas.edu).

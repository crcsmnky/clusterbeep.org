I am the Head of Retail Solutions for Google Cloud, developing reference architectures, best practices, and sample code for retailers looking to migrate and scale using public cloud infrastructure. My technical focus areas are container-based deployments and large-scale data technologies. 

My formal background is in software engineering and I have worked for several companies, big and small over the last 17 years, including Google, Apple, and MongoDB. Over the course of my career I've helped build complex cloud and large-scale data infrastructure deployments, and products spanning distributed graph processing, social network analysis, document similarity, and wireless networking.
